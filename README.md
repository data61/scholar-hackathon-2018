# 2018 Data61 summer scholars data-driven art prize

The goal of the summer scholar coding activity is to write software to produce an artwork from one or more datasets. We recommend forming teams of 2-3, with 4 the absolute maximum.

## What is a data-driven artwork?
Whatever you think of as an artwork. We encourage you to use the data to create something beautiful or challenging: a picture, an animation, some music, a poem, a story, a sculpture, or something else! The theme of the competition this year is "The Natural World".

## How does the competition work?
Each artwork be able to be generated from one more datasets, from software written during the hackathon (not beforehand). The data can be taken from the list below, or you can find your own data. Either way, we suggest you download it before the day.

## Prizes?
The current prize categories may include the following (though they may also change on the day depending on the volume of submissions)
  - Best data-driven visual artwork
  - Best data-driven audio artwork
  - Best data-driven text artwork
  - Best data-driven physical artwork (sculpture or performance)
  - Artwork with the most insight into the data
  - Most original data-driven artwork

## What should I bring?
Bring along laptops with your development environment already set up. Make sure you have the data you intend to use already downloaded. The artworks will be presented to the judges so make sure it is possible to put them on a projector or play them through a speaker etc.
